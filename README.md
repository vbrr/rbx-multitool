# rbx-multitool
This is a program I'm currently developing for roblox and adding more features to.

I am not going to put the source code for this on here, as the entire ui is Hard-coded and it looks like shit.

If it does get flagged as a virus, it's because it downloads and runs RobloxPlayerBeta.exe, While reinstalling roblox.
